The 'Virtual Fabric Manager' (VFM) serves the data center fabric needs of the
fast growing converged I/O, FC-based storage networking, and blade server
markets.  The next generation data center fabric equipment and services TAM is
forecasted at $150B.  The SAN market commands a $2B TAM and is predominantly FC 
with 10-15% CAGR through 2011.  Cisco and Brocade's initiatives in the Fibre 
Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) space validate the moves in the data center to 
converge I/O over 10GigE networking while maintaining connectivity to FC 
storage.  Blade and virtualized servers - the fastest growing segments of the 
server market are further exacerbating the need for converged I/O and networked 
storage, aka technologies like FCoE with virtualized I/O capabilities.  VFM will
empower networking semiconductor vendors, networking infrastructure and server 
OEMs to offer FCoE switch/bridge, virtualized I/O management and dynamic server 
management solutions.  VFM will serve as cost-effective and more complete 
alternate solutions to those offered by Cisco and Brocade. 


The VFM setup is currently in a very generic mode and has capabilities of
FCoE and IBoE and works on the data-link layer. It can be easily configured 
with the OpenFCoE stack.

The work is still in progress and anyone interested in helping out in this
effort is welcome to join us.
