Note regarding external code
============================

To enable testing prior to BridgeX availability, this directory includes some
code which approximately simulates a subset of BridgeX behavior.

'ext' code is considered throwaway code.  It includes code borrowed from open
source examples, and is meant for use only in limited test scenarios.
Therefore, all 'ext' code is not subject to code review or the quality
standards of VPS.
