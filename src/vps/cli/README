Directory Structure of CLI source code:

Main Directory: "/src/vps/cli"  
       This dir contains two files "vps_cli.py" and "command_ref.py". 
       The main function is in vps_cli.py which takes the arguments to 
       invoke CLI in debug or XML mode. The command_ref.py file contains the 
       dictionary for the commands and the files that implement these commands
       The commands are in a folder named "commands".

Sub Folder:
          1. commands
	  2. lib

       "commands" folder contains all the commands which will be invoked 
	by the __import__ function in the lib/interpreter.py. 
        
	"lib" folder contains all the library files which are used by the
        commands file to invoke and check functions.    

How to run:
	Run CLI automatically when logged in using SSH:
        -----------------------------------------------
	
	Step 1: Create an user account for example "admin".
	Step 2: Create public and private keys for the user to enable security
		and a safe ssh session.
        Step 3: Copy the CLI source code to the machine from the repository 
		on which you created the user.
	Step 4: Steps to enable CLI prompt on login :
		Step 1: Create a shell script e.g. 'vps_cli.sh' in "/bin".
		Step 2: Add a following line in the script:
			"python <path-to-repository>/src/vps/cli/vps_cli.py"
		Step 3: Give execute permissions to the script for the admin
			user.
		Step 2:	Open /etc/passwd as root. e.g. "vim /etc/passwd"
		Step 3: Search for the 'admin' user in the file.
		Step 4: Change the user line "/bin/bash" or any other shell,
			 with "/bin/vps_cli.sh"
		Step 5: Login into the machine with that user. 
	 
	Run CLI manually:
	-----------------
	This mode is for debugging and testing purpose:

	Step 1. cd /src/vps/cli
	Step 2. ./vps_cli.py

	The user should be logged into the CLI with this prompt :
	BridgeX Manager Version 0.0.1
	BXM> 

	Type 'help' or '?' for the list and a desciption all commands.
	NOTE: Not all commands listed in 'help' are implemented.
 
Database setup:
	Till the CLI is integrated with the main process, we have created a
	dummy database for debugging and testing purpose. The dummy db file is
	checked into the source. Please look for 'bxm.db' in 'src/vps/cli' dir.
 
	For running the CLI manually please copy "bxm.db" to you local machine
	at "/usr/local/vps/bxm". Please create the path if it does not exist.

	Example:	
	Step 1. cd /usr/local
	Step 2. mkdir -p vps/bxm
	Step 3. cp <path-to-git-repos>/src/vps/cli/bxm.db /usr/local/vps/bxm

	Note : You should be a root user to do manupulations in the database.
